#---------------
# How it works |
#---------------
# Step 1: Read the original trace and create the scan file for each device that participates in the 
# experiment (ID <= 76). For each device a file will be created inside the folder ./tmp/scans. The
# file format is "(scanning)time device(that scans) device(scanned)".
#
# Step 2: Read the scan file for each device and create a discovery file inside the folder ./tmp/discoveries.
# A disovery file will be created for each device. The contents of the discovery file are the devices that are 
# scanned during the scanning procedure of the main device. 
# The file format is "(scanning)time dev1 dev2 ... devN". Note that N is different from each time instance.
#
# Step 3: Read the discovery file of each device and create a contact file inside folder ./tmp/contacts.
# For each device ID that exists in each line find the line (below that line) that the ID does not exist. 
# The start line matches to the start contact time and the end line matches to the end contact time. Using this
# method, the duration between contacts is at least equal to one scanning interval (~120 secs). 
#
# Step 4: The contact file for every device is read line by line. If a line occurs multiple times, then all 
# instances are removed except one. The results for each device ID are stored inside folder ./tmp/clean-contacts.
#
# Step 5: All device contacts are aggregated to one file. 
# 
# Step 6: Two lists are created containing device IDs. The first list contains inactive device IDs, that do not
# have any contact entry in the contact file. The second list consists of active devices that participate at 
# least to one contact event. 
#
# Step 7: The contact file is sorted based on the contact start time (3rd column).
#
# Step 8: Normalize the event times in order to get the starting event (first contact of the trace file) at time 0.
#
# Step 9: Get the time that each device appears in the trace. That is needed because every device participates in the
# experiment at different time instances. It can be used by the simulator at the traffic generation phase in order to 
# avoid genearating packets destined to nodes that have not joined the experiment (at a given time).
#
# Step 10: Write the summary file that contains the lowest and the highest event time in the trace file.
#
#Notes: Nodes with ID over 100 do not participate in the experiment
#       First Node has ID 1
#	A contact has a duration that is larger or equal to one scanning interval (~120 secs)
