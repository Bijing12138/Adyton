#---------------
# How it works |
#---------------
# Step 1: Clean the dataset. Remove all external noise that is the set of devices with ID larger than 97. Also, remove all
# time events that are out of the experiment duration. The time limits of the experiment are from 2004-07-26 00:00:00
# to 2005-05-05  23:59:59.
# 
# Step 2: Two lists are created containing device IDs. The first list contains inactive device IDs, that do not
# have any contact entry in the contact file. The second list consists of active devices that participate at 
# least to one contact event. 
#
# Step 3: The contact file is sorted based on the contact start time (3rd column).
#
# Step 4: Normalize the event times in order to get the starting event (first contact of the trace file) at time 0.
#
# Step 5: Remove contacts that occur between nodes with same id.
#
# Step 6: Read the contact file  line by line. If a line occurs multiple times, then all instances are removed except one.
#
# Step 7: Get the time that each device appears in the trace. That is needed because every device participates in the
# experiment at different time instances. It can be used by the simulator at the traffic generation phase in order to 
# avoid generating packets destined to nodes that have not joined the experiment (at a given time). 
#
#Notes: First Node has ID 1
